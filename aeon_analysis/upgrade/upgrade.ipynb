And some common questions look at how subjects in such environments make estimates of which patch contains the most resources at any given time, and explore vs. exploit behavior.\n",

    "So the core component of the environment is the arena where our animals live and forage. We spent a good chunk of time thinking about modular designs that would be large enough to mimic ethological exploration, foraging, and shelter seeking of mice. We settled on a circular design in which the floor and walls are fully modular. Here you can see images from two STP files of the arena. The floor and walls are both made of acrylic, the floor white matte acrylic, the walls semi-transparent red acrylic. The floor is comprised of regular hexagonal patches: there are 19 \"full\" patches in the middle of the arena, and 37 total patches that make up the floor, including those that extrude along the outer rim. Each hexagon has a side length of 21.5cm, making its area roughly 0.12 m^2, and the total area inside the arena is about 2.6m^2. Harvest mice typically forage at a distance of around 3-5 meters from their nests, so this arena provides a nice simulation of that. The walls measure roughly 37 x 40 cm, and 5 mm thick. The arena design provides for the ability to have up to 6 nests on patches around the outer rim. A corridor of width about 5 cm leads from the nests to an entrance (or possibly multiple entrances) into the arena proper. And you can see on the right that we have currently designed for three patches to have feeders installed, though theoretically any of the 19 patches could be a food patch, and they are easily replaceable.

    "Ok, next we needed to design food and shelter resources in the environment. We spent a lot of time thinking about how best to simulate ethological foraging, and we settled on an approach that simulates natural digging / burrowing: the food patch consists of a wheel and an underground feeder: the mice have to spin the wheel a certain distance threshold, and when this threshold is reached, the pellet dispenser, or what we often refer to as \"feeder\", delivers a small food pellet into pockets on the wheel. The feeder is powered with a 24V 1A power supply, and contains a hopper basin that can be preloaded with probably nearly 10k 20 ug pellets. The feeders are controlled via a Raspberry Pi Pico that runs micropython and serves as a HARP device so that it can be easily integrated into our Bonsai workflow - but I'll discuss this in a little more detail when we get to Experiment Control. And it's not shown here, but a magnet is attached onto the wheel, and a magnetic encoder attached to the patch a couple mm away from the magnet so that we can measure wheel distance spun via changing magnetic field strength. \n",

    "The nest measures roughly 24 x 40 cm, and is fitted with an embedded scale at the bottom, and holes for water bottles on the side. In practice when running experiments, we fill the nest with bedding and enrichment to mimic their normal homecages."

One simple thing we might want to do is asynchronously update plots while running the experiment, for example a trajectory plot, a heatmap plot, and a plot that shows the current wheel threshold until pellet delivery. And by having a distinct stream for each of these updates, that's exactly what we can do.

    "Ok, so one last subfocus of the Experimental Control & Data Acquisition subgroup worth mentioning is how we've solved for time-alignment. Harp stands for: \"hardware advanced research platform\", and is a group that operates in the Chamaplimaud Center that work on GPIO devices for experimental neuroscientists. They use the name \"Harp\" also to refer to the binary protocol they use to encode and pass data and messages between Harp devices and computers. One particularly nice thing about Harp devices is that they were engineered to share a clock signal between them - there is a main harp device that carries a clock signal that gets daisy-chained to X number of other worker Harp devices. Every second, the main harp devices also sends a \"heartbeat\" pulse to all worker devices, to align their times to its time. The maximal discrepancy in clocktime we typically see between Harp devices is less than 100 us. This is super valuable. Additionally, we trigger our camera frames via a Harp camera controller, and we receive input from the wheel and send commands to the feeder via harp devices, so all devices we record from share the same clock. So using Harp, we get full device time-alignment for free."

    "Now I'll briefly mention how data is organized in our two main stores: our directory structure on our Ceph partition, and in tables in our Database.\n",
    "\n",
    "On Ceph, we've formalized our folder structure such that in our main Project data directory, `/ceph/aeon/aeon/data`, we have three different types of data folders: raw, qc (which stands for quality control), and processed, that have roughly parallel structures. 'Raw' is data we acquire online which we consider immutable: only the acquisition computer which acquired this data can write to this folder. We've then structured the data by experiment name, acquisition epoch (which just corresponds to the timestamp at which we started running the Bonsai experiment workflow), and device. So an easy way to read this is that experiments are made of epochs that contain data from a certain number of devices, and all epochs for a given experiment contain the same devices. By convention, if you change devices, this means you are running a new experiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "The 'qc' and 'processed' data directories contain the same logic, except 'qc' contains the output of data quality-checks in 'parquet' table-like format, and 'processed' data can be any type of data we want to save after running some processing on the raw data (e.g. think spike or behaviour-classification data)\n",
    "\n",
    "And here is a quick visual of a particular table in our database, that is largely managed by DataJoint. The top-level table in this diagram is the Experiment table, which is manually created at the start of every new experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Manual = green (manualy added at start of experiment)\n",

    "So when we started thinking about interfaces to access and visualize the data, we realized we wanted both high-level and low-level interfaces to the data. We started with building a low-level API to access the raw data as it is on Ceph, upon which we built high-level interfaces. Again in line with our technical requirements, some key considerations were:\n",
    "\n",
    "- reusability\n",
    "- modularity\n",
    "- generalization\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we wanted to ensure backwards and forwards compatibility was easy to maintain with the API, and we wanted others to be able to extend it. To make a longer story short, we realized one way to accomplish this was to introduce core concepts of \"schema\", \"devices\", and \"streams\". \"Streams\" correspond to single datastreams, single individual datafiles in Ceph. Each of these streams can be read via a Reader class that knows how to process the data in that stream (binary or text data). \"Devices\" correspond to the \"device\" folders on ceph, and can be made up of one or more streams. For example, a patch device can be made up of an encoder stream (the magnetic encoder for the wheel), a pellet delivery stream, and a patch depletion function stream. And a \"schema\" corresponds to all the devices and streams that make up a particular dataset: you can think of having a different schema for each unique experiment you conduct. And so what we really wanted to accomplish was that even if you use different devices in different experiments, i.e. had two different schemas, you could still use the same underlying code to access data from both experiments, and things would not break.

From individual sessions with constant patch replenishment functions, for the patch parameters we tested, we have roughly seen that they can dinstinguish patches that are >2x apart (e.g. after controlling for initial bias, if they get a reward for spinning a wheel on one patch at 200cm, the other patch has to be at least 400cm before we see a significant difference in patch preference). For probabilistic patches where the replenishment function is an Exponential, early results indicate a similar threshold for patch discrimination, maybe closer to 3x, but this testing is still ongoing.\n",
