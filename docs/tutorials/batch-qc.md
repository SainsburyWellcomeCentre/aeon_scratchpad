# Batch QC with benchmarks.yaml

For systematic QC across multiple datasets and epochs, a script that reads a `benchmarks.yaml` manifest and produces YAML reports and pickled results for every epoch.

For interactive use on a single dataset window, see [Interactive QC on an Aeon dataset](run-qc.md).

---

## How it works

`benchmarks.yaml` lists datasets and the epochs that you want to QC. The script `scripts/run_benchmarks.py` iterates every epoch, runs `run_qc` over the epoch's time window, and saves a YAML report and a pickled results dict for each one.

**Time window per epoch:** `start` comes from the manifest. `end` is the next epoch's `start`. For the last epoch in a dataset, `end` is determined by scanning epoch directories on disk to find the next one after `start`. If no subsequent epoch exists on disk, `end` is `None` and the window is open-ended. If an `end` is given in the manifest, it is used instead: only epochs whose `start` precedes it are included. Epoch gaps are reported as part of the QC. They indicate Bonsai had crashed and restarted, automatically or manually.

## The benchmarks.yaml format

```yaml
datasets:

  - name: social02-aeon3                              # unique identifier, used in output paths
    root: /ceph/aeon/aeon/data/raw/AEON3/social0.2   # path to the dataset root on the cluster
    schema: social02                                  # REGISTRY key (see table below)
    epochs:
      - {phase: presocial,  start: "2024-01-31T11-28-39"}
      - {phase: presocial,  start: "2024-02-01T22-36-47"}
      - {phase: social,     start: "2024-02-09T16-07-32"}
      - {phase: postsocial, start: "2024-02-25T17-22-33"}

  - name: octagon-conf1
    root: /ceph/aeon/aeon/data/raw/OCTAGON01/conf1
    schema: octagon01
    epochs:
      - {ssid: 24997, start: "2024-03-25T12-16-27"}
      - {ssid: 25010, start: "2024-03-25T12-41-07"}

  - name: harris-ses-043                              # schema: null skips this dataset, only placeholder
    root: /ceph/aeon/aeon/data/raw/aeon/test2/harris_benchmark_rawdata/ses-043_date-20251223
    schema: null
    epochs: []
```

### Field reference

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | yes | Unique identifier, used as the output subdirectory name |
| `root` | one of `root`/`roots` | Absolute path to the dataset root |
| `roots` | one of `root`/`roots` | List of roots searched together, behaviour root first. Use it when ephys data recorded on another machine lives under its own rig folder. The ONIX devices found in the later roots are added to the schema. Epoch discovery and epoch gaps use the first root. |
| `schema` | no | REGISTRY key. Omit it (or set `null`) to build the schema automatically: registry match on the root path, then `Metadata.yml` (Harp, camera and ONIX devices), then filesystem discovery. A missing `schema` does not skip the dataset. |
| `end` | no | UTC ISO 8601 timestamp capping the dataset. Only epochs whose `start` precedes this are processed. The final epoch's window closes here. Without it, the final epoch's `end` is found by scanning epoch directories on disk. If no subsequent epoch exists, the window is open-ended. |
| `epochs` | yes | List of epoch entries. An empty list `[]` does not skip the dataset: every epoch directory under the first root is discovered and run, with the load window derived from the chunk filenames. Only a missing root skips a dataset. |
| `epochs[].start` | yes | Epoch start timestamp in filesystem format (`2024-01-31T11-28-39`) or ISO 8601 (`2024-01-31T11:28:39+00:00`). Naive strings are assumed UTC |
| `epochs[].phase` | no | Label used in output filenames (e.g. `presocial`, `social`) |
| `epochs[].ssid` | no | Session ID label used in output filenames (alternative to `phase`) |

### Available schema keys

| Key | Experiment |
|---|---|
| `exp02` | Foraging (two patches, AEON1/2) |
| `social02` | Social 0.2 (AEON3/4) |
| `social03` | Social 0.3 (AEON3/4) |
| `social04` | Social 0.4 (AEON3/4) |
| `octagon01` | Octagon 0.1 (OCTAGON01) |
| `socialephys01` | ONIX ephys test recording (AEONX1, NeuropixelsV2Beta headstage) |
| `abcephys01` | ForagingABC ephys (NeuropixelsV2 headstage only, paired with the behaviour root via `roots`) |

### Finding epoch start timestamps

Epoch start timestamps correspond to Bonsai session starts. Each session creates a new epoch directory under the dataset root named by its UTC timestamp. You can list them on the cluster:

```bash
ls /ceph/aeon/aeon/data/raw/AEON3/social0.2/
# 2024-01-31T11-28-39  2024-02-01T22-36-47  2024-02-02T00-15-00  ...
```

Paste the directory name directly as the `start` value. No conversion is needed:

```yaml
- {phase: presocial, start: "2024-01-31T11-28-39"}
```

---

## Running the script

From the repository root:

```bash
uv run python scripts/run_benchmarks.py [options]
```

### Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--benchmarks PATH` | `benchmarks.yaml` | Path to the benchmarks manifest |
| `--output DIR` | `benchmarks_output/` | Root directory for output files |

Before a long run, `scripts/dry_run_benchmarks.py --benchmarks PATH` checks that every root exists and that every reader in the schema has at least one file per epoch, without loading anything.

### Run

```bash
uv run python scripts/run_benchmarks.py

# Use a different manifest or output directory
uv run python scripts/run_benchmarks.py --benchmarks /path/to/my_benchmarks.yaml --output /path/to/results/
```

---

## Output layout

```
benchmarks_output/
  social02-aeon3/
    presocial_2024-01-31T11-28-39.yaml   # human-readable QC summary
    presocial_2024-01-31T11-28-39.pkl    # pickled results dict
    presocial_2024-02-01T22-36-47.yaml
    presocial_2024-02-01T22-36-47.pkl
    social_2024-02-09T16-07-32.yaml
    ...
  octagon-conf1/
    24997_2024-03-25T12-16-27.yaml
    ...
```

The filename stem is `{label}_{start}` where `label` is the `phase` or `ssid` field from the epoch entry. The YAML report format is described in [Interactive QC, generating a YAML report](run-qc.md#generating-a-yaml-report). The console prints one verdict line per epoch (heartbeat gaps, frames dropped, order violations, ONIX anomalies, streams with no data) so a run can be followed without opening the reports.

---

## Summarising a run

```bash
uv run python scripts/summarise_benchmarks.py --input benchmarks_output/
```

writes `summary.csv` and `summary.md` in the output directory with one row per epoch: dataset, label, window, hours, epoch count, heartbeat gaps and dropout, worst sync delta, HarpSynch alerts, dropped frame events and frames, continuous-stream gap events, missing samples, irregular runs, sample count and largest interval ratio, timestamp order violations, pellet failures, log errors, HarpSync `Seconds` offset and faults, the worst HarpSync step deviation, the worst hourly fit residual, ONIX clock rate in ppm, ONIX clock events, the largest hub clock deviation and streams with no data. This table is the first thing to look at after a run and the one to paste into an issue.

### Judging a run against thresholds

`thresholds.yaml` maps summary columns to the largest acceptable value. The summary script flags every epoch with a value above its threshold. It adds an `n_flags` count and a `flags` column (for example `fit_worst_chunk_ms=0.31>0.1`) and prints the flagged epochs. Thresholds only flag: every measured value stays in the table and the reports. To test against a different threshold, edit the file and rerun the summary script. QC does not need to run again.

```bash
# default: thresholds.yaml in the repository root
uv run python scripts/summarise_benchmarks.py --input benchmarks_output/

# your own thresholds. --strict exits with status 1 if any epoch is flagged
uv run python scripts/summarise_benchmarks.py --input benchmarks_output/ --thresholds my_thresholds.yaml --strict

# no judging
uv run python scripts/summarise_benchmarks.py --input benchmarks_output/ --no-thresholds
```

A key that is not a summary column is rejected with the list of valid names. A typo cannot silently disable a check. The shipped values are starting points to review. They cover measured ONIX timing values only. Counts of faults that should never happen, such as heartbeat gaps, dropped frames or out-of-order timestamps, are not judged: any nonzero count in the table is itself the error report. Other measured columns such as sync delta are reported without judging. Any summary column can be added to the file.

## Loading saved results

```python
import pickle
from pathlib import Path

pkl_path = Path("benchmarks_output/social02-aeon3/presocial_2024-01-31T11-28-39.pkl")
with open(pkl_path, "rb") as f:
    results = pickle.load(f)

# results is the same dict[str, pd.DataFrame] returned by run_qc
df = results["ClockSynchronizer.Heartbeat"]
print(f"{len(df)} heartbeat gap(s)")
```

---

## Adding a new dataset

1. Find the dataset root on the cluster. For an experiment with ephys, also find the ephys rig folder (the ephys machine robocopies to `raw/<COMPUTERNAME>/<experiment>/`) and list both under `roots`.
2. Add an entry to `benchmarks.yaml`. Leave out `schema` unless the dataset needs a bespoke registry entry (octagon). Leave `epochs: []` to run every epoch on disk, or list the epochs you want with their phase labels.
3. Run `scripts/dry_run_benchmarks.py` to confirm the roots and files are visible, then `scripts/run_benchmarks.py`.
4. Run `scripts/summarise_benchmarks.py` and read `summary.md`.
